        <p class="speech">The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
        happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
        leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
        space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would beabsolutely worn to shadows.</p><br>

        <h6 class="name MRS.ALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
        to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p>

        <p class="speech">It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
        escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
        power and use it.</p>

        all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
        place.</p>
