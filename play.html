            [_Ladies seated on sofas_.]<br>


        MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
        little! <br>

        LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?<br>

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.<br>

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!<br>

        MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
        happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
        leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
        space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would beabsolutely worn to shadows.<br>

        [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]<br>
        
        LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?<br>
        
        MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
        to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.<br>-
        
        LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
        escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
        power and use it.<br>
        
        LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
        all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
        place.<br>
        
        MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?<br>
        
        LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.<br>
